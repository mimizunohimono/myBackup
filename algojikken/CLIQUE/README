In this directory is c++ code that implements 
the algorithms described in Sections:

	4.3   Generating All Cliques.
	4.6.3 The Maximum Clique Problem

of 

"Combinatorial Algorithms: Generation Enumeration and Search"
by D.L. Kreher and D.R. Stinson
CRC Press (1998).

The files included are:


File name	contents/purpose

README		This message

defs.h		header file
setlib0.h	header file

setlib0.c	Library of elementary set operations.

allcliq.c	Algorithm 4.4  for computing all of the cliques.
maxc.c		Algorithm 4.19 for computing a maximum clique.
rg.c		Algorithm 4.20 for computing a random graph.

	remark: Check the tops of these files for more details.

seed		A file containing a seed for the random number
		generator

sample		A sample graph 

makefile	The makefile for compiling the programs.

To compile the programs first check the makefile to see if it 
calls the c++ compiler on your machine with the right flags, etc.
Then type  "make all"
